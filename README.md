R-scripts

For calculation of growth rate r and capacity K:
use the scripts starting with "OD_"
If you just want to plot the data, use "OD_r_K_plots"
If you want to analyze the structured data, use "OD_r_K_analysis"
If you want start from scratch, and calculate r and K, use "OD_rK_comparison_wrangling"
You can either use the MixPulse16 or MixPulse25 dataset, depending on how many sampling you want to include.

The same system applies for the count data.
